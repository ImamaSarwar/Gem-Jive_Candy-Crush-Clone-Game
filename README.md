## Features
### Login System

### Progressive Levels
- The game includes a level-based system where new levels are unlocked based on the playerâ€™s cumulative score, increasing in complexity as the game progresses.
### Hint System
- An integrated hint feature assists players by suggesting a valid move when no immediate chain is visible, helping maintain gameplay flow.
### State Control (Play/Pause/Resume)
- The game  supports play, pause, and resume functionality, allowing users to manage their gameplay sessions effectively.
### Menus
